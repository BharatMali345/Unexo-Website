    <p>
      As organizations adopt new technologies to deliver scalable services
      faster and more reliably, continuous IT resource optimization and service
      assurance have become major challenges. Proactively plan, manage, and
      optimize on-premises, SaaS, and modern Kubernetes and containerized
      applications to keep pace with business demand.
      <br />
      <br />
      Deeper insight: Increase visibility into risk, efficiency, costs, and
      overall health and status for business services and applications with
      self-service and consolidated business service vices, "what-if"
      simulations, and automated alerts
      <br />
      <br />
      Intelligence and automation: Automate optimization recommendations and
      actions based on Al-fueled insights and machine learning to ensure
      accurate right-sizing of resources through performance comparisons across
      on-premises and SaaS resources
      <br />
      <br />
      Modernization: Determine the optimum allocation of your Kubernetes Pods
      across multiple clouds and identify problems related to saturation or over
      allocation of resources to help right size Pod workloads

        <h2 class="pb-1">Visualize business service and costs</h2>
        <p>
          Service assurance and continuous optimization provide ongoing
          visibility to the entire IT infrastructure-on premises, physical,
          virtual, cloud, Kubernetes, Pods, microservices, and container-based
          applications. You'll gain insights into the risk, use, performance,
          and providers of IT resources with the ability to drill down to the
          device level.
        </p>
        With consolidated views of overall health and status of business
        services, application and infrastructure metrics provide insights into
        the risk, efficiency, and cost of the resources running a service

        <br />
        Self-service dashboards and custom views that keep stakeholders informed

        <h2 class="pb-1">Optimize IT resource and spend</h2>
        <p>
          With Al-fueled intelligence, machine learning, and analytics your
          resource and cost optimization opportunities are automatically
          identified. Automated actions for right-sizing resources and
          terminating unused resources, such as idle virtual machines, can be
          taken to immediately obtain cost savings.
        </p>
        Dynamically optimize infrastructure resources for the varying demands of
        your applications including those based on Kubernetes, microservices,
        containers, and Pods

        <br />

          Use predictive analytics and business KPIs to determine the IT
          resources you need to support increases in business demand due to
          special events or business growth. "What if modeling provides insight
          into the best resource configuration, location, and cost so you can
          make an informed decision and prevent application performance
          slowdowns or failures.
